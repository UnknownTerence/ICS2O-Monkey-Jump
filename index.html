      <p id="gameDesc">
        For this summative project I have decided to make a game in phaser. The game I have come up with is called "Monkey Jump", a platform parkour based game. There will be multiple levels and the goal of the game is to make it to the end of the level. There will be platforms and if the player makes contact with dangerous objects like spikes they will lose a life, if they have run out of lives they will restart the level. The player will have a total of 3 lives. Throughout the map there will be powerups that will boost speed, jump height, or even take away a life. For the resources I will need images for the powerup items, different background scenes, platforms, effects to show that the player has a powerup active, pixel hearts to indicate amount of lives, sound effects for walking, jumping and powerups, background music to feel more engaged and finally the monkey. There will be a minimum of 6 screens, a title screen, help screen, levels screen, game screen, end screen, and a screen for each of the levels.

      <h2 id="concernsHeader">Concerns and Potential Problems</h2>
      <ul id="concernsDesc">
        <li>
          The first problem that I might face is animations. With animations I will need to find a way to create them and try to make them work at the press of a key ie. pressing the left arrow and the monkey starts walking left with an animation.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          The second problem is about the levels. I think that it will be hard to try and program different levels that will only unlock once the previous level was completed. Adding to this, another problem is having a menu screen with all the levels to choose from.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          The third problem is about checkpoints. I will have to figure out how to make it so that after the player has touched or reached a checkpoint they will respawn there. Another issue would be making it so the player can replay the level if they want to.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
          The fourth problem will be about movement. Since the game is a parkour game, there will need to be a jumping function. I think this will be hard to try to create a jump and gravity to pull the player down to the ground.
